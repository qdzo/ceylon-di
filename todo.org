* CHANGES
** Remove support for Classes in registerEnhancer
   - If someone requests Class, and i have enhancer for it, i will fail, cos my enhacner should extend class
     and this requires additional modifications of target class (default annotations).
   - If someone requests intersectionType and target is appropriate, but enhancer implement partial interfaces
   - It's not convenient to wrap only needed class (interface is more useful in this situation)
